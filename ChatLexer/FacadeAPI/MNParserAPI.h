 The Facade design pattern provides a single interface to a complex subsystem. Instead of exposing the user to a set of classes and their APIs, you only expose one simple unified API.
 
 Like Facade API MNParserAPI provides the client app a single point to parse the chat message into
 meaningfull components and also interact with URLs to fetch the title associated with it.
